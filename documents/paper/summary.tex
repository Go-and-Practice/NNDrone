\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

It has been demonstrated that for the case of a high energy physics
event selection application, a drone neural network is able to accurately
approximate and learn the features of a neural network with a different
structure. The proposed algorithm design allows the drone to learn the
aforementioned features without ever having access to the training data,
or indeed any data, but only with appropriate questioning of the original model.

The equivalency of the outputs of the drone and original model enables an
analyst to treat both the original and the drone in the same way. The creation
of a drone in a standardised form permits an analyst to use any desired machine-learning
package to isolate a decay signature, and from this create a classifier
guaranteed to be suitable for execution in the {\tt C++} real-time data selection frameworks.
