### Folder structure

The skLearn folder holds ML classifiers trained with the SciKit-Learn
package along with associated drones.

The format for contributions is intended to be as follows:
- **Type X** - main folder
    - Python scripts to reproduce results
    - **history** - contains drone training history
    - **models** - contains files of the models and scalers used
    in addition to the saved dron networks
    - **perf** - folder containing the performance plots of the drone
    network and the original classifier
