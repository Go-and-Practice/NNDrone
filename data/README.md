## Data

Sample date from open source pakages to test and provide examples
of the software.

### RapidSim

The RapidSim package (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07489) is used to
generate sample B and D decays. The scripts used to generate the
sample data are provided in the **RapidSimGen** folder.
 - signal_data.p - 10k Bs->J/ψφ decays
 - background_data.p - 10k D->ππππ decays

### Pythia + Fastjet

Pythia + FastJet are used to make simulated jet objects more like
the data found in general purpose detectors such as ATLAS and CMS.
 - signal_data_gpd.p - Jet information for simulated W + jet events.
 - background_data_gpd.p - Jet information for QCD jets.
